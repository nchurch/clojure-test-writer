Usage:
use t to enter code at REPL, s to save it as a test to a file:

=> (t (+ 1 5))
6
=> (s)

writes
(clojure.contrib.test-is/is (clojure.core/= #^#=(clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap/create {:line 30}) (+ 1 5) 
6))
to test file

(s result)
will create a test from the last t'd expression asserting expr = result.

Run (load-file) on the testfile to test all the tests

Missing features: different files by namespace, integration with existing test frameworks.
